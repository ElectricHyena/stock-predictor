The fact it jumped again 7 days later proves it was NEW INFO.\n\nPredictability Factor:\nThis is LEAST predictable of all events. It's a secondary disclosure that\nrequired earnings-call listening or company interaction. Retail investors\nhad essentially ZERO chance of predicting this move.\n\nReality Check:\nThe +3.16% move combined with the earlier +2.17% earnings move created\nthe +6.13% cumulative 5-day rally.
